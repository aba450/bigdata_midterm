   (2502). GARNISHING OF  EGGS  &#224; LA DEVELLE (Garniture d'&#x152;ufs &#224; la Develle).  Cut in two crossways seven or eight shelled  hard-boiled eggs;  use only the halves with the rounded ends and from them remove all the  yolks  and rub through a sieve; put this into a small vessel and add to it a little cold aspic  jelly  (No. 103); (scoop the  whites  out lightly). Pound the cooked  meats  of a small  lobster,  press through a sieve into a bowl and season with  salt  and a dash of  cayenne;  add first two spoonfuls of  white  chaudfroid  sauce  (No. 596), then some mayonnaise  sauce  (No. 606), and lastly a few spoonfuls of the cold  jelly;  stir this preparation on ice to harden, then take up sufficient of it with a spoon and fill the hollow  egg-whites,  smoothing the tops dome-shaped; lay them in the ice box; when cold take them in the hand one by one and dip into a chaudfroid  sauce,  but only on the garnished side and as far down as this begins; have the  sauce  hardened. Dress on  jelly  rings cut out with a pastry cutter, keeping the dish very cold. When the  eggs  are ready decorate the tops with fanciful cuts of  truffles  and a few small  shrimp tails;  dip them one by one in half-set  jelly  and stand them upright, each one inside of one of the  jelly  rings.

Perhaps, in explaining why this is, it would be well to describe in full the potter's art; for curious enough it is to have long ago merited attention; only, that it was not until the later cliffdwellings and mesa villages were built that it reached its highest productiveness and perfection.The clay which served for their wares was seldom taken from the native quarries without prayers and propitiatory offerings. Dependently upon the kind of vessel to be made, it was the subject of careful choice. It was brought from the distant sources of supply in the form of dry lumps, which, as needed, were pulverized on the metates, and mixed with crushed quartz,sand, or potsherds, then moistened and kneaded until in condition to be easily dented with the tip of the tongue.The clay which served for their wares was seldom taken from the native quarries without prayers and propitiatory offerings.
